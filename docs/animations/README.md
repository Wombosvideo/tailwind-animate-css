# Animations

- [Enter/Exit Animations](./in-out.md) can be used to animate elements when they enter or exit the DOM. This is useful for creating smooth transitions between different states of your application.
- [Accordion Animations](./accordion.md) can be used to animate the opening and closing of accordions. This allows for a more visually appealing experience when interacting with accordions.
- [Collapsible Animations](./collapsible.md) can be used to animate the opening and closing of collapsible elements. This is an alias for accordion animations.
- [Caret Blink Animation](./caret-blink.md) can be used to create a blinking caret/cursor effect. This is useful for custom input fields or text areas where you want to indicate that the user can type.
